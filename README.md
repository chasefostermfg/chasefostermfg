## Chase Foster
Co-founder of **Carbon Manufacturing Systems**.

We help manufacturing businesses who need full control over their software and a single system to run their entire operation.

### About Carbon
We are an open-source platform that provides manufacturers with access to their source code, allowing businesses to build and manage their own fully integrated software stacks.

### Background
Before Carbon, I worked in software sales at Salesforce, AWS, and GCP. I am now focused on building tools that give manufacturers more flexibility and ownership of their technology.
